# All inzva related stuff

Includes (almost all),
- **Problems**
- **Test Case Generators**
- **Lecture Notes**

I've prepared for inzva so far :)

I'm being truly honest â€” I keep all inzva related stuff in this folder in my own PC :D

Just discover by yourself, no need to explain what is where :P *(not that it's all a mess!)*

Note that there are some hidden *special* problems that aren't public yet. I'm planning to use them for *special* contests ;)
